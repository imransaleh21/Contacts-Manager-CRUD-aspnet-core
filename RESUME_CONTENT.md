## LaTeX Template Usage

```latex
\projectentry{\href{https://github.com/imransaleh21/Contacts-Manager-CRUD-aspnet-core}
{Person List Management System -- ASP.NET Core MVC (CRUD) {\color{blue}\footnotesize\faLink}}}
{A CRUD web application with sorting, filtering, and data export options (PDF, CSV, Excel). Built with a clean, scalable, and maintainable design using SOLID principles and a layered architecture. Uses modern ASP.NET Core practices including dependency injection, validation, EF Core and proper unit testing.}
{Learning by Doing:}
{Implemented clean architecture with repository pattern and dependency injection for loosely coupled, testable code. Built dynamic sorting using reflection and custom validation attributes. Created comprehensive unit and integration tests using xUnit, Moq, and FluentAssertions. Integrated Entity Framework Core with code-first migrations, fluent API configurations, and stored procedures for optimized database operations.}
{Tech Stack \& Tools:}
{ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC, C\# 12, Entity Framework Core 9.0, SQL Server, xUnit, Moq, AutoFixture, FluentAssertions, Rotativa (PDF), EPPlus (Excel), CsvHelper}

## Alternative Variations (Choose Based on Space)

### Shorter Version (if space is limited)
```latex
{Learning by Doing:}
{Implemented clean architecture with repository pattern and dependency injection. Built dynamic sorting with reflection and custom validations. Created comprehensive unit/integration tests. Integrated EF Core with code-first migrations, fluent API, and stored procedures.}
{Tech Stack:}
{ASP.NET Core 8.0 MVC, C\# 12, EF Core 9.0, SQL Server, xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions, Rotativa, EPPlus, CsvHelper}

### Longer Version (if more space available)
```latex
{Learning by Doing:}
{Implemented clean layered architecture separating concerns across domain, service, repository, and presentation layers. Applied repository pattern with dependency injection for loosely coupled, highly testable code. Developed dynamic property sorting using reflection to eliminate code duplication. Created custom validation attributes for business rules (e.g., minimum age validation). Built comprehensive test suite with unit tests (Moq, AutoFixture) and integration tests (WebApplicationFactory, in-memory database). Integrated Entity Framework Core with code-first migrations, fluent API for entity configurations with check constraints, and stored procedures for complex queries.}
